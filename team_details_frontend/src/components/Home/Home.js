      <h3>Welcome to Team Details ! </h3>
      <p>
        Team is composed of members who are dependent on each other, work
        towards interchangeable achievements, and share common attainments. A
        team works as a whole together to achieve certain things. A team is
        usually located in the same setting as it is normally connected to a
        kind of organization, company, or community. Teams can meet in-person
        (directly face-to-face) or virtually when practicing their values and
        activities or duties. A team's communication is significantly important
        to their relationship.
